         <p> Butterflies have <em> six </em> jointed legs, a pair of antennae and three body parts called a head, thorax (chest), and abdomen (tail end). The four wings and the six legs of a butterfly are attached to its thorax. <strong>Special sensors on a butterfly or moths' feet allow the insect to taste their food </strong></p>
